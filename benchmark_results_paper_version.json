    "question": "Who is Albert Einstein?",
    "description": "Basic biographical question about a well-known scientist",
    "ground_truth": "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theories of special relativity and general relativity, provided the quantum explanation of the photoelectric effect, and contributed foundational work to statistical mechanics, Brownian motion, and early quantum theory. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. He was born on 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (German Empire), and died on 18 April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. He was a human, male. His parents were Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch. He was married to Mileva Mari\u0107 (1903\u20131919) and later to Elsa Einstein (1919\u20131936). His children were Hans Albert Einstein, Eduard Einstein, and his daughter Lieserl Einstein, whose early life is documented through correspondence. He held German citizenship at birth, became Swiss in 1901, and American in 1940. He studied at ETH Zurich, earning a teaching diploma in physics and mathematics, and completed his doctorate at the University of Zurich under Alfred Kleiner. He worked at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern and held academic positions at the University of Zurich, Charles University in Prague, ETH Zurich, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and later the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His notable scientific contributions include special relativity, general relativity, mass\u2013energy equivalence (E=mc\u00b2), the Einstein field equations, the explanation of the photoelectric effect, theoretical work on Brownian motion, Einstein coefficients, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics (with S. N. Bose), and the Einstein\u2013Rosen bridge (with Nathan Rosen). His doctoral students included Nathan Rosen and Ernst G. Straus, and he collaborated with scientists such as Marcel Grossmann, S. N. Bose, and Leo Szilard. He received major recognitions including the Copley Medal in 1925 and the Max Planck Medal in 1929. In 1905, his Annus Mirabilis, he published four revolutionary papers that transformed modern physics. He advocated for civil rights in the United States, supported W. E. B. Du Bois, signed the Einstein\u2013Szilard letter in 1939 urging U.S. research into nuclear chain reactions, supported the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and later declined the presidency of Israel in 1952. His brain was removed for scientific study after his death, an action that is historically documented and widely discussed. The chemical element einsteinium (atomic number 99) was named in his honor.",

    "ground_truth": "Marie Curie was born on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire (Congress Poland). She was a pioneering physicist and chemist best known for discovering the elements polonium and radium, developing the theory of radioactivity, establishing experimental techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and laying the foundations of nuclear physics, radiochemistry, and medical radiation therapy. She was a human, female. She died on 4 July 1934 in Passy, France, from aplastic anemia caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. Her parents were W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sk\u0142odowski and Bronis\u0142awa Sk\u0142odowska. She married Pierre Curie in 1895 and remained married until his death in 1906. She had two daughters, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and \u00c8ve Curie. She studied at the clandestine Flying University in Warsaw and later at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), earning degrees in physics and mathematics. She held academic positions at the University of Paris and later directed research at the Radium Institute in Paris, becoming the first woman professor at the Sorbonne. Her scientific fields included radioactivity, experimental physics, and radiation chemistry. She received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel) for research on radiation phenomena, and the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of radium and polonium and the isolation of radium. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry). She directed the development and deployment of mobile X-ray units during World War I, personally training operators and assisting with battlefield radiology. She also played a central role in establishing two major research centers\u2014the Radium Institute in Paris and a parallel institute in Warsaw\u2014both of which became leading hubs for nuclear science and medical radiology.",

No historical, academic, scientific, or biographical records contain this name, so no connection of any kind exists. Alan Turing was a human mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, computer scientist, and theoretical biologist. He was born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London, England, and died on 7 June 1954 in Wilmslow, Cheshire, England. He was male and held British citizenship. His parents were Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara Turing. He never married and had no children. He studied at Sherborne School, then at King's College, Cambridge, where he completed major mathematical work, and later earned his PhD at Princeton University under Alonzo Church. He worked at King's College Cambridge, the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park during World War II, the National Physical Laboratory, and the University of Manchester. His fields of work included mathematical logic, computability theory, cryptanalysis, early computer architecture, and developmental biology. His notable achievements included the formulation of the universal Turing machine, foundational contributions to computation theory, major contributions to breaking the German Enigma cipher during World War II, and the proposal of the Turing Test for machine intelligence. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts and forced to undergo chemical castration; he died by suicide in 1954, and was posthumously pardoned by the British government in 2013.

    "question": "Describe the joint research between Einstein, Bohr, and Dr. Selwyn Hartmere on quantum mechanics.",
    "description": "Real scientists mixed with fictional - partial hallucination trap",
    "ground_truth": "There was no joint research between Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Dr. Selwyn Hartmere because Dr. Selwyn Hartmere is not a real person and therefore no collaboration involving this fictional name ever existed. Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr were real physicists, but they did not conduct joint research together; instead, they engaged in famous scientific and philosophical debates about quantum mechanics, especially at the Solvay Conferences in the 1920s and 1930s. Their interactions were intellectual arguments over foundational issues such as determinism and the Copenhagen interpretation, not co-authored work or shared experiments. Albert Einstein was a human theoretical physicist born on 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, German Empire, and he died on 18 April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. He held German, Swiss, and American citizenships, was male, and his occupations included theoretical physicist and professor. His parents were Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch. He married Mileva Mari\u0107 and later Elsa Einstein and had two sons, Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Einstein. He studied at ETH Zurich and held academic positions at the University of Zurich, Charles University in Prague, ETH Zurich, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His scientific fields included relativity, quantum theory, statistical physics, and cosmology, and his major achievements included special relativity, general relativity, the photoelectric effect, and foundational contributions to early quantum physics. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Copley Medal, and the Max Planck Medal. Niels Bohr was a human theoretical physicist born on 7 October 1885 in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he also died on 18 November 1962. He held Danish citizenship, was male, and his parents were Christian Bohr and Ellen Adler Bohr. He married Margrethe N\u00f8rlund and had children including Aage Bohr, who became a Nobel laureate. Niels Bohr studied at the University of Copenhagen and worked with J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford in Cambridge and Manchester. He founded the Institute for Theoretical Physics (now the Niels Bohr Institute) at the University of Copenhagen. His scientific fields included atomic structure, quantum theory, and nuclear physics. His major achievements included the Bohr model of the atom, foundational contributions to quantum mechanics, and the principle of complementarity. He received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics and numerous international honors, and he later contributed as a scientific advisor to the Allied nuclear effort during World War II. Because Dr. Selwyn Hartmere does not exist, no factual properties or collaborations can be attributed to this name.",

    "question": "Compare the contributions of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage to computing.",
    "description": "Comparison of two related historical figures",
    "ground_truth": "Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage made foundational but distinct contributions to the early history of computing. Charles Babbage, a human mathematician, inventor, and mechanical engineer, conceived the Difference Engine and designed the Analytical Engine, introducing key architectural principles of modern computers including a memory store, a processing unit (the mill), conditional branching, loops, and programmable operations. (His pioneering work has earned him recognition as the 'father of the computer'.) Ada Lovelace, a human mathematician and writer, studied the Analytical Engine, translated and expanded Luigi Menabrea\u2019s paper on it, and added extensive annotations that included the algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers\u2014widely regarded as the first published computer program, making Lovelace widely regarded as the world\u2019s first computer programmer. Lovelace also articulated the theoretical insight that the machine could manipulate symbols beyond numerical calculation, envisioning general-purpose computing and early notions of software. Ada Lovelace was born on 10 December 1815 in London, England, died on 27 November 1852 in Marylebone, London, held British citizenship, was female, and her parents were Lord George Gordon Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron. She married William King-Noel, later Earl of Lovelace, and had three children: Byron, Anne Isabella, and Ralph. She studied mathematics privately under mentors such as Augustus De Morgan and Mary Somerville and worked primarily as an independent thinker. Her fields included mathematics and early computational theory. Charles Babbage was born on 26 December 1791 in London, England, died on 18 October 1871 in London, held British citizenship, was male, and his parents were Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. He married Georgiana Whitmore and had several children. He studied at Trinity College and Peterhouse, Cambridge, later became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, and worked on mechanical computation, mathematical tables, and precision engineering. He is often regarded as the 'father of the computer' for his pioneering inventions. His designs for the Analytical Engine influenced later generations of computer scientists and historians. Babbage provided the conceptual hardware architecture of computing, while Lovelace contributed the earliest software concepts and theoretical understanding of symbolic computation, and they collaborated intellectually on the Analytical Engine project.",

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer.\nAda Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet\nLord Byron\nand reformer\nAnne Isabella Milbanke\n.\nAll her half-siblings,\nLord Byron's other children\n, were born out of\nwedlock\nto other women.\nLord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left\nEngland\nforever. He died in\nGreece\nwhilst fighting in the Greek War of Independence, when she was eight. Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter's upbringing and promoted Lovelace's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived\ninsanity\n. Despite this, Lovelace remained interested in her father, naming one son\nByron\nand the other, for her father's middle name,\nGordon\n. Upon her death, she was buried next to her father at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies assiduously.\nShe married\nWilliam King\nin 1835. King was already a Baron, and was created Viscount Ockham and 1st\nEarl of Lovelace\nin 1838. The name Lovelace was chosen because Ada was descended from the extinct\nBaron Lovelaces\n.\nThe title given to her husband thus made Ada the Countess of Lovelace.\nLovelace's educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as\nAndrew Crosse\n, Charles Babbage,\nSir David Brewster\n,\nCharles Wheatstone\nand\nMichael Faraday\n, and the author\nCharles Dickens\n, contacts which she used to further her education. Lovelace described her approach as \"poetical science\"\nand herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\nWhen she was eighteen, Lovelace's mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage. She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the\nAnalytical Engine\n. Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, when she and\nher mother\nattended one of\nCharles Babbage's Saturday night soir\u00e9es\nwith their mutual friend, and Lovelace's private tutor,\nMary Somerville\n.\nThough Babbage's Analytical Engine was never constructed and exercised no influence on the later invention of electronic computers, it has been recognised in retrospect as a\nTuring-complete\ngeneral-purpose computer which anticipated the essential features of a modern electronic computer; Babbage is therefore known as the \"father of computers,\" and Lovelace is credited with several computing \"firsts\" for her collaboration with him.\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Lovelace translated\nan article\nby the military engineer\nLuigi Menabrea\n(later\nPrime Minister of Italy\n) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with\nseven long explanatory notes\n.\nThese notes described a method of using the machine to calculate\nBernoulli numbers\nwhich is often called the first published\ncomputer program\n.\nShe also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.\nLovelace was the first to point out the possibility of encoding information besides mere arithmetical figures, such as music, and manipulating it with such a machine. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes), examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.\nAda is widely commemorated (see\nCommemoration\nbelow), including in the names of a programming language, several roads, buildings and institutes as well as programmes, lectures and courses.\nThere are also a number of plaques, statues, paintings, literary and non-fiction works.\nBiography\nChildhood\nLord Byron\nexpected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when\nLady Byron\ngave birth to a girl.\nThe child was named after Byron's half-sister,\nAugusta Leigh\n, and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.\nOn 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at\nKirkby Mallory\n, taking their five-week-old daughter with her.\nAlthough English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,\nbut did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.\nAda Byron, aged four\nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the\ndeed of separation\n, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.\nAside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour.\nThis set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in April 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.\nLovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.\nAda Byron, aged seven, by\nAlfred d'Orsay\n, 1822,\nSomerville College, Oxford\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.\nIn one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"\nLady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.\nAda Byron, aged seventeen, 1832\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.\nIn June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of\nmeasles\n. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\nWhen Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the\nanatomy of birds\nto determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book,\nFlyology,\nillustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.\nLovelace never met her younger half-sister,\nAllegra\n, the daughter of Lord Byron and\nClaire Clairmont\n. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have s\n\n[Article truncated...]\n\n=== END OF ARTICLE ===\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Extract facts relevant to the question from this article.\nOnly use information explicitly stated in the article above.\n\n[Tool: fetch_wikipedia_article]\n=== Wikipedia Article: Charles Babbage (Q46633) ===\n\nCharles Babbage\nEnglish mathematician, philosopher, and engineer (1791\u20131871)\nCharles Babbage\nKH\nFRS\n(\n/\n\u02c8\nb\n\u00e6\nb\n\u026a\nd\u0292\n/\n; 26 December 1791\n\u2013 18 October 1871) was an English\npolymath\n.\nA mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.\nBabbage is considered by some to merit the title of \"\nfather of the computer\n\".\nHe is credited with inventing the first\nmechanical computer\n, the\ndifference engine\n, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in his\nanalytical engine\n, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the\nJacquard loom\n.\nAs part of his computer work, he also designed the first\ncomputer printers\n.\nHe had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers, covered in his 1832 book\nEconomy of Manufactures and Machinery\n.\nHe was an important figure in the social scene in London, and is credited with importing the \"scientific soir\u00e9e\" from France with his well-attended\nSaturday evening soir\u00e9es\n.\nHis varied work in other fields has led him to be described as \"pre-eminent\" among the many polymaths of his century.\nBabbage, who died before the complete successful engineering of many of his designs, including his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, remained a prominent figure in the ideating of computing. Parts of his incomplete mechanisms are on display in the\nScience Museum\nin London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from the original plans. Built to\ntolerances\nachievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.\nEarly life\nPortrait of Charles Babbage (\nc.\n1820\n)\nBabbage's birthplace is disputed, but according to the\nOxford Dictionary of National Biography\nhe was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row,\nWalworth Road\n, London, England.\nA\nblue plaque\non the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.\nHis date of birth was given in his obituary in\nThe Times\nas 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of\nSt. Mary's\n,\nNewington\n, London, shows that Babbage was\nbaptised\non 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.\nBabbage\nc.\n1850\nBabbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of\nWilliam Praed\nin founding Praed's & Co. of\nFleet Street\n, London, in 1801.\nIn 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in\nEast Teignmouth\n. Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in\nAlphington\nnear Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time, he attended\nKing Edward VI Grammar School\nin\nTotnes\n, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.\nBabbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood Academy, in Baker Street,\nEnfield\n,\nMiddlesex\n, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman.\nThe academy had a library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near\nCambridge\n; through him Babbage encountered\nCharles Simeon\nand his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed.\nHe was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.\nThe second was an\nOxford\ntutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by the\nUniversity of Cambridge\n.\nAt the University of Cambridge\nBabbage arrived at\nTrinity College, Cambridge\n, in October 1810.\nHe was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;\nhe had read\nRobert Woodhouse\n,\nJoseph Louis Lagrange\n, and\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi\n. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university.\nBabbage,\nJohn Herschel\n,\nGeorge Peacock\n, and several other friends formed the\nAnalytical Society\nin 1812; they were also close to\nEdward Ryan\n.\nAs a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as\nThe Ghost Club\n, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.\nIn 1812, Babbage transferred to\nPeterhouse, Cambridge\n.\nHe was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.\nAfter Cambridge\nConsidering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the\nRoyal Institution\non astronomy in 1815, and was elected a\nFellow of the Royal Society\nin 1816.\nAfter graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of a career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at\nHaileybury College\n; he had recommendations from\nJames Ivory\nand\nJohn Playfair\n, but lost out to\nHenry Walter\n.\nIn 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the\nSociety of Arcueil\n, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists.\nThat year Babbage applied to be professor at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n, with the recommendation of\nPierre Simon Laplace\n; the post went to\nWilliam Wallace\n.\nWith Herschel, Babbage worked on the\nelectrodynamics\nof\nArago's rotations\n, publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by\nMichael Faraday\n. The\nphenomena\nare now part of the theory of\neddy currents\n, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of\nelectromagnetic theory\n, staying close to\nAmp\u00e8re's force law\n.\nBabbage purchased the actuarial tables of\nGeorge Barrett\n, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in\nComparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives\n.\nThis interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by\nFrancis Baily\nand mooted in 1824, but not carried out.\nBabbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using\nEquitable Society\nmortality data from 1762 onwards.\nDuring this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a home in\nMarylebone\nin London and established a large family.\nOn his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around \u00a3100,000, equivalent to \u00a3\n10.9\nmillion\nor $\n15\nmillion\ntoday), making him independently wealthy.\nAfter his wife's death in the same year he spent time travelling. In Italy he met\nLeopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany\n, foreshadowing a later visit to\nPiedmont\n.\nIn April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become a professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nBabbage was instrumental in founding the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nin 1820, initially known as the Astronomical Society of London.\nIts original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data.\nThese directions were closely connected with Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its\nGold Medal\n, cited \"for his invention of an engine for calculating\nmathematical\nand\nastronomical tables\n\".\nBabbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since\nDionysius Lardner\nwrote about it in 1834 in the\nEdinburgh Review\n(under Babbage's guidance).\nThe context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve\nThe Nautical Almanac\n. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables.\n\n[Article truncated...]\n\n=== END OF ARTICLE ===\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Extract facts relevant to the question from this article.\nOnly use information explicitly stated in the article above.",

The organization was founded in 1919, operated at Bletchley Park during the war, and later became the foundation of GCHQ. Alan Turing was a human mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, computer scientist, and theoretical biologist born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London, and he died on 7 June 1954 in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He held British citizenship, was male, and his parents were Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara Turing. He never married and had no children. Turing studied at Sherborne School, King's College Cambridge, and earned his PhD at Princeton University under Alonzo Church. He worked at King's College Cambridge, the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, the National Physical Laboratory, and the University of Manchester. His fields included mathematical logic, computability theory, cryptanalysis, early computer architecture, and developmental biology. His major achievements included formulating the universal Turing machine, foundational contributions to computation theory, breaking key components of the Enigma cipher during World War II, and proposing the Turing Test for machine intelligence. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his scientific contributions. In 1952, Turing was convicted under British law for homosexual acts and subjected to chemical castration; two years later, in 1954, he died by suicide. In 2013, he received a posthumous royal pardon.",
